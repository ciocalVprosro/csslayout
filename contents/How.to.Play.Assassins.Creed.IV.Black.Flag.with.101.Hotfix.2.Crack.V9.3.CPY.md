## Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Tips
 
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is not just a game about assassinating targets and exploring historical settings. It is also a game about sailing, fighting, hunting, and looting as a pirate. If you want to make the most of your adventure in the Caribbean, you will need some tips and tricks to help you survive and thrive. Here are some of the best gameplay tips for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

- **Board (Don't Destroy) Enemy Ships**: When you damage an enemy ship enough, it is unable to move or attack. It is essentially dead in the water. That means you can bring your ship, the Jackdaw, up alongside it. After boarding the ship and killing some crew members, you take all of the ship's cargo. This is the most efficient way to obtain upgrade materials. If you don't board the ship and choose to destroy it instead, you can only salvage a fraction of the valuables it was carrying[^1^].
- **Disabled Ships Are Like Floating Health Packs**: When you're confronted with multiple ships at once, your first instinct might be to finish combat first and then board all of them to clean up. However, in tough fights, you are better off boarding mid-combat. The reason is this: Once you start boarding an enemy ship, the other nearby ships stop attacking you. Once you finish, you have three options: lower wanted level, add to Kenway's fleet, or repair the Jackdaw. So, if you're getting low on health, you can select \"repair the Jackdaw,\" then return to your previous naval conflict with more health[^1^].
- **Keep Your Wanted Level**: You might think that having a bunch of aggressive ships after you is a bad thing, but a steady stream of hunters makes it easy to load up on the resources that you can only find by plundering other ships. Metal is particularly useful when upgrading the Jackdaw, and the hunter ships usually have it. You want to bring down the intensity eventually (constant Man O' War attacks are not good), but riding with the infamy for a while can be far more lucrative than playing it safe[^2^].
- **Get Shanties**: They might just seem like another collectible, but these songs are one of my favorite parts of the whole game. Your crew sings as you sail (which you spend a lot of time doing), and I love the assortment of these tunes. Every one you collect gives your mates another available song in their repertoire, and lets you hear a wider selection of the sometimes-funny, sometimes-sad ditties[^2^] [^3^].
- **You Can Buy Animal Skins**: Hunting is the most economical way to obtain valuable items, but sometimes it's a pain to travel around and find that elusive jaguar or shark that you need to complete an upgrade. Just stop by the store and check out the hunting materials for sale. You'll pay a premium, but in the long run, the extra money might be worth the hassle you save[^2^].

These are just some of the tips that can help you enjoy Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag more. There are many more secrets and surprises waiting for you in this game, so don't be afraid to explore and experiment. Happy pirating!
